Tetris is a video game created by Russian designer Alexey Pajitnov in 1985 that allows players to rotate falling blocks strategically to clear levels. Pajitnov claimed he created the name of the game by combining the Greek prefix tetra, which refers to the four squares contained in each block, with the word tennis.
